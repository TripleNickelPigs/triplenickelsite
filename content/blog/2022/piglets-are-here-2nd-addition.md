Dottie had her babies on the 5th too! What a blessed day on the farm! At 12:50pm Dottie began her labor. I wish I could report that her labor and delivery were just as successful as Sophia’s but alas, I cannot. When her first piglet started his journey into the world he managed to get stuck. So stuck in fact, that Jason had to gently help to get him unstuck and perform baby CPR on the little guy. We were quite worried about him for the first few minutes because he just couldn’t get the hang of this walking around and suckling stuff. Eventually after a bit of rest, he figured out how to suckle and is doing fantastic. This was only the beginning of her tiresome day. After a very laborious 4 hours, Dottie had seven viable babies. Unfortunately, six out of seven were breech (the babies came feet first). When babies are born breech it takes longer for them to move down the birth canal and is much harder on mama and baby. Poor Dottie cried most of her labor and there wasn’t much we could do to make it better. At the end, there was one baby left and it was in the canal so long and under so much stress that it didn’t make it. She did birth a “mummy”, which is an undeveloped fetus, this was a first for the farm. All the babies that were born viable are doing great and mama has no lasting repercussions from her very long hard day. We are so blessed that everything turned out okay and we look forward to seeing these little ones grow!
