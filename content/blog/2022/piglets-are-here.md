Today is a very exciting day at the farm! This morning at 6:27am our Sow Sophia gave birth to her first litter! She ended up having 11 very viable little piggy’s and they are just the cutest things you have ever seen! Her labor and delivery went without a single hitch and we couldn’t be more proud of this first time Mama. She will definitely be getting some extra tasty treats when she is up to eating again.

Sophia is a Hampshire/Duroc cross that we acquired from Jeremy Mellick when we received our boar Hamilton. Hamilton is a pure blooded Berkshire and is indeed the daddy to these little gems. We couldn’t be more happy with the turn out of this farrowing! WELL DONE SOPHIA!
