We acquired Bubbles as a weaner pig from a large pork processing plant during the major 2019 Eastern states shut down. It is believed she is a litter mate with Queen B. We are not entirely sure of her heritage. We do know that she is a Duroc/Landrace cross, which is optimal for pork production. We have yet to successfully breed her, although it is not from lack of trying. She got her name because of she truly enjoys blowing bubbles in her mud puddles.
