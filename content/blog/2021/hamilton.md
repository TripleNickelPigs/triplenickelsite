Hamilton was bred by Jeremy Mellick from Mellick Premium Pork. Hamilton is a pure bred Berkshire. Berkshires are known for the marbling in their meat and are considered the “wagyu beef” in the pork industry. Jeremy put so much effort into the breeding of his own pigs on his farm that it transferred to us by proxy of Hamilton. The pigs on Jeremy’s farm are heritage pigs and are traced back many, many generations for their quality. Hamilton is currently about 10 months old and is already getting to work on the farm with siring the next batch of little piglets. Hamilton is quite docile so far and we are working hard to keep him that way so that we can continue to interact with him through out his growth safely. We expect him to grow to over 1,000 lbs. Hamilton’s father is the “Big Kahuna” on Jeremy’s farm and he is a gigantic pig. We expect Hamilton to fall right in his daddy’s footprints on size and shape. We are truly grateful to have acquired him to be the main sire on our farm.
