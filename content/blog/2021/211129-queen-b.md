We acquired Queen B as a weaner pig from a large pork processing plant during the major 2019 Eastern states shut down. We are not sure of her heritage. Although, the piglets she has produced for us are phenomenal in stature. We do know that she is a Duroc/Landrace cross, which is optimal for pork production.
