## FAQ

How do we do our pricing?

> We, at Triple Nickel, are committed to honesty and transparency in our pricing. We pride ourselves on no hidden fees or hidden costs to our customers. Our pork comes from our farm to your table. Price for a whole pig is $1,000.00 plus butchering. Price for half a pig is $600 plus butchering.

How does the beef shares work?

> When they are available, we will make an alert on the main page. Black Angus Beef (limited shares) require a $500 deposit to hold a share. The final price will dependent on the actual hanging weight. Price is $4.00 per lb. hanging weight plus butchering with the deposit contributing to the final cost.

 Why deposits?

> Deposits are needed to hold purchases and provide some funding that will take the animal to harvest. A $500 (half amount) will be required for a whole pig.

Why isn’t there deposit for half pig shares?

> Currently, Triple Nickel is still in the startup phase of business. As such, half of a half doesn’t provide enough funding and requiring a $500 deposit didn’t sound logical to us with it only being $100 shy of the final cost. So the $600 (full amount) is required for a half pig share at weaning to secure a share.

Do you sell piglets?

> Yes we do!

When can I get my piglet?

> Piglets are weaned at eight weeks from birth. Pickup is usually schedule for the next Saturday from weaning.

I really want to purchase some of your pork but I don’t want a half or whole share. How can I get just a couple of pounds or a specific cut?

> Because Triple Nickel is in the startup phase we do not yet have our own butchery or regular access to a USDA butcher. Please email Tamra if you would like to discuss more on this topic.

Why is the butchering fee separate?

> We do not have our own butchery…yet. That is in the next phase of our growth in which we will also be providing butchery services. Until then butchering fees are paid directly to the butcher when your order is picked up.
