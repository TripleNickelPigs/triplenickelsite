How do we do our pricing?
\
\
We, at Triple Nickel, are committed to honesty and transparency in our pricing. We pride ourselves on no hidden fees or hidden costs to our customers. The product comes from our farm to your table.
\
\
Price for a **whole pig** is $1,200.00 + *butchering.
\
\
Price for **half a pig** is $650 + *butchering.
\
\
A word on **deposits**. To secure your purchases, $600 (half amount) is required for a **whole pig**, $650 (full amount) is required for a **half a pig** at weaning (eight weeks from the birth of the piglets). Please email [Tamra](mailto:tamra@triplenickelpigs.com) if you would like to discuss more options.
\
\
\*Butchering fee is paid to the butcher when order is picked up.
