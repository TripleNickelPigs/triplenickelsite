How do we do our pricing?
\
\
We, at Triple Nickel, are committed to honesty and transparency in our pricing. We pride ourselves on no hidden fees or hidden costs to our customers. The product comes from our farm to your table.

A word on **deposits**. To secure your purchases, a $600 deposit is **required at weaning** (eight weeks from the birth of the piglets) for butchered products, and half of the sales price for all other products (i.e. $150 for a piglet). If a deposit is not secured by weaning the product will be offered to the next person on the wait list.

Please email [Tamra](mailto:tamra@triplenickelpigs.com) if you would like to discuss more options.

\
\*Butchering fee is paid to the butcher when order is picked up.
