      <description>The time that we all were waiting for finally arrived! Dora had 9 babies on the 12th of February. Unfortunately, only one survived. We did not know she was even in labor until we saw a piglet following her the next morning. Jason went to feed like normal and to check her out to see if she was starting labor, looked up and saw a cute little red piglet following her around trying to nurse.</description>
