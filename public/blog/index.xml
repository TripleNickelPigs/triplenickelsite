      <description>The time that we all were waiting for finally arrived! Dora had 9 babies on the 12th of February. Unfortunately, only one survived. We did not know she was even in labor until we saw a piglet following her the next morning. Jason went to feed like normal and to check her out to see if she was starting labor, looked up and saw a cute little red piglet following her around trying to nurse.</description>

      <description>Dottie had her babies on the 5th too! What a blessed day on the farm! At 12:50pm Dottie began her labor. I wish I could report that her labor and delivery were just as successful as Sophia’s but alas, I cannot. When her first piglet started his journey into the world he managed to get stuck. So stuck in fact, that Jason had to gently help to get him unstuck and perform baby CPR on the little guy.</description>

      <description>Today is a very exciting day at the farm! This morning at 6:27am our Sow Sophia gave birth to her first litter! She ended up having 11 very viable little piggy’s and they are just the cutest things you have ever seen! Her labor and delivery went without a single hitch and we couldn’t be more proud of this first time Mama. She will definitely be getting some extra tasty treats when she is up to eating again.</description>

      <title>Hamilton</title>

      <description>Hamilton was bred by Jeremy Mellick from Mellick Premium Pork. Hamilton is a pure bred Berkshire. Berkshires are known for the marbling in their meat and are considered the “wagyu beef” in the pork industry. Jeremy put so much effort into the breeding of his own pigs on his farm that it transferred to us by proxy of Hamilton. The pigs on Jeremy’s farm are heritage pigs and are traced back many, many generations for their quality.</description>

      <description>We acquired Bubbles as a weaner pig from a large pork processing plant during the major 2019 Eastern states shut down. It is believed she is a litter mate with Queen B. We are not entirely sure of her heritage. We do know that she is a Duroc/Landrace cross, which is optimal for pork production. We have yet to successfully breed her, although it is not from lack of trying. She got her name because of she truly enjoys blowing bubbles in her mud puddles.</description>

      <description>We acquired Queen B as a weaner pig from a large pork processing plant during the major 2019 Eastern states shut down. We are not sure of her heritage. Although, the piglets she has produced for us are phenomenal in stature. We do know that she is a Duroc/Landrace cross, which is optimal for pork production.</description>
